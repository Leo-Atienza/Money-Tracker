# Session Handoff — v5.0.0 Release Branch

> **📘 NEXT SESSION: read [`docs/NEXT_SESSION_HANDOFF.md`](docs/NEXT_SESSION_HANDOFF.md) FIRST.** It is the self-contained finish-and-ship plan: complete context + environment setup + the full ordered remaining-work plan (audit fixes → SQLCipher → goldens → perf → version bump → ship) + an exhaustive per-function test plan for the entire app (every model/util/DB/AppState/screen/widget function, marked ✅/🟡/❌). This file (Session 10 notes) is the supporting history.

---

## ⭐ Session 10 (2026-06-26) — autonomous audit + fix arc (READ THIS FIRST; supersedes older sections)

**Branch**: `release/v5.0.0`. Started at `1efcd72` (session-9 D.2 hero widget tests, which the older sections below do NOT reflect). NOT yet pushed to origin this session.

**Environment unlocked this session**: Android emulator `emulator-5554` (Pixel-class, API 36) is available and was used for real device verification via the `mobile` MCP + `adb` at `C:/Users/leooa/AppData/Local/Android/Sdk/platform-tools/adb.exe`. **This removes the "no device" blocker** that deferred Stage A / SQLCipher / perf for 9 sessions. The emulator currently has the app installed (debug) with **App PIN = `1234`** set (leftover from H1 verification — disable it in Settings or `adb uninstall com.moneytracker.app` for a clean visual pass).

### What landed (commits this session, all device- or preflight-verified)
1. `20a5d57` **fix(test)**: de-rotted a wall-clock-fragile test. The full suite was RED at session start (`1892 pass / 1 fail`) — `app_state_crud_test.dart` "date moves across months" hardcoded April/May 2026 dates that fell out of `AppState`'s 2-month in-memory window (`_loadExpensesInternal`, keyed off `DateHelper.today()`) once the calendar passed May. Anchored to `today()`. Green: **1893 pass / 3 skipped**.
2. `6a14555` **fix(ui)**: SYSTEMIC black-background regression. `OrganicBlobBackground` lived ONLY inside `MainNavigationScreen`'s Stack, but ~14 screens (onboarding, PIN setup/unlock, and every pushed child screen — Settings, Budgets, Category Manager, Trash, Export, Backup, Crash Log, Recurring, Quick Templates, Notification Settings) use transparent Scaffolds and assumed a global blob that never existed. `PremiumPageRoute` is opaque → those screens rendered on a **black window background** with near-illegible dark-on-dark glass/text. Fixed by painting the blob once in `MyApp.build` via `MaterialApp.builder` (below Navigator, inside Theme); removed the redundant MainNav copy. **Verified on emulator**: onboarding, Home, Settings, PIN setup all render the light blob with legible glass. (Never caught before because device smokes were never run + widget tests build their own MaterialApp.)
3. **(pending commit, preflight running)** `fix(security)` H1: app never re-locked on resume. `_checkPinLock` ran only at cold start; after background→foreground (process alive) or inactivity timeout, `_isLocked=true` but the unlock screen was never re-presented → all financial data visible without the PIN. Added a resume re-check + re-entrancy guard, and gated `_handlePaused`'s `lock()` on `isPinEnabled` (so a PIN-less user is never trapped). **Verified end-to-end on emulator**: set PIN 1234 → HOME → `am start` (live resume, "task brought to front") → unlock screen re-appeared → 1234 unlocks. FLAG_SECURE also confirmed (screenshot black while locked).

### The big deliverable: `docs/AUDIT_FINDINGS_2026-06.md`
A 10-dimension adversarial Workflow audit (86 agents, every finding refute-verified) produced **62 confirmed findings** (0 critical, 2 high, 19 medium, 41 low). Full prioritized list with file:line + surgical fix per finding is in that doc. The blob regression + H1 + the wall-clock test are already fixed and NOT in the list.

### Recommended next-session order (all now device-verifiable)
1. **H2 (HIGH)** — PIN is single-round SHA-256; migrate to PBKDF2 (100k iters, already used by `BackupCrypto`) with migrate-on-verify. `lib/utils/pin_security_helper.dart:230`. Needs async refactor of `_hashPinWithSalt` + device test of set/verify/legacy-upgrade.
2. **M17/M18/M19 (notifications actually work)** — taps never routed (no response callback registered; payloads never attached → whole nav pipeline dead); "Reminder Time" setting cosmetic (hardcoded 09:00); toggling a reminder doesn't schedule until next load. All surgical, specified in the audit doc. `notification_helper.dart` + `app_state.dart`.
3. **A11y cluster (M8–M12)** — unlabeled icon buttons, <48dp targets, no textScaler clamp, swipe-delete has no a11y equivalent. Play-Store quality bar.
4. **M1** — `addPayment` auto-rounds sub-10¢ to "fully paid" → records money never paid (money correctness). Confirm intent vs fix.
5. **Perf (M3–M7)** — PDF/CSV on UI isolate (compute()), analytics O(n·m) rebuild, history non-virtualized groups + per-tile controllers, GlassPanel RepaintBoundary.
6. Then the pre-existing roadmap: **6.1 SQLCipher** (now device-testable), **D.3 goldens**, **8.2 perf pass**, **8.4 version bump + CHANGELOG**, **8.5 ship**. See `docs/FINISH_LINE.md`.

### Double-check pass (2026-06-27) — 2 more fixes found + landed
Adversarially re-verified the above on the emulator and caught two more issues:
- `fe13147` **fix(security)**: the `isPinEnabled()` gate I added to `_handlePaused` sat before its try block, so a secure-storage read error would have skipped the DB-close / widget-dispose maintenance. Wrapped it (maintenance always runs; fails open → never traps a PIN-less user). Verified: PIN-less background→resume stays on Home (no unlock screen).
- `1d7cf3c` **fix(onboarding)**: "Load Sample Data" never worked on a fresh install — `_loadSampleData` called `addCategory('Transport')` which throws because Transport is a DEFAULT category, aborting the whole load. Now tolerates pre-existing categories. Verified: seeds $3000 income + 4 expenses, lands on Home at $2845.00.

Full visual matrix verified on device: light + dark mode, empty + seeded data, onboarding + nav-tab + pushed routes all render the blob with legible glass. H1 re-lock verified with PIN (unlock screen re-appears on live resume) and FLAG_SECURE confirmed (black screenshot while locked). **All 6 session-10 commits are preflight-green (1893 pass / 3 skipped).** Confirmed audit finding **M14** is real on-device: visible amounts show `$2845.00`/`$3000.00` with no thousands separator while the a11y labels correctly show `$2,845.00`/`$3,000.00`.

### Notes for next session
- `DateHelper.today()` uses raw `DateTime.now()` but `_selectedMonth` uses `Clock.instance` — a time-source inconsistency worth reconciling (and it makes the month-window untestable via Clock injection). Low priority but real.
- Money is `Decimal` in Dart but stored as `REAL` in SQLite — "INTEGER cents" migration is explicitly v5.1 (out of scope).
- Two preflight runs this session were green at 1893 pass / 3 skipped. `flutter analyze` clean throughout.

**Branch**: `release/v5.0.0` — pushed to origin during session-8. `origin/main` is fast-forwarded to the same SHA.
**Master plan**: `docs/MASTER_PLAN.md`
**Per-task checklist**: `docs/CHECKLIST.md`
**📍 Forward-looking playbook to finish the app**: **`docs/FINISH_LINE.md`** — read this first. It supersedes `SESSION_7_PLAN.md` with all post-session-7 deltas baked in.
**Prior plan (superseded)**: `docs/SESSION_7_PLAN.md`
**Next-steps plan**: `docs/NEXT_STEPS.md`
**Last committed work at handoff**: session 8 — **Phase 5.5 Add Transaction merge** (`196b3ab`), preflight regex tolerance for skipped tests, **D.1 remainder** appended +24 mutator tests.
**Paused**: 2026-05-12 (Session 8 — **Phase 5 is now 20/20 complete**; D.1 is complete; remaining gates are Stage A device smokes, Stage C SQLCipher, D.2/D.3 hero widget tests + goldens, Stage E ship pipeline.)

> To resume: `git fetch && git status` (should be clean and in sync), then read `docs/FINISH_LINE.md` top-to-bottom plus this file. With Phase 5.5 + D.1 remainder done, the next non-device gate is Stage D.2 (hero widget tests with seeded data) → D.3 (goldens). Stage A device smokes + Stage C SQLCipher are still the device-dependent items.

---

## Session 8 — what landed (commits beyond `5e29f9a`)

| Commit | Phase | What |
|---|---|---|
| `196b3ab` | 5.5 | `lib/screens/add_transaction_screen.dart` — single Luminous-styled screen replacing `add_hub_screen.dart` + `add_expense_screen.dart` + `add_income_screen.dart`. `GlassTopAppBar` + `GlassSegmentedControl<TransactionType>` + `CategoryBentoGrid`. Leading slot conditional on `Navigator.canPop`. R15 toggle preservation (`_amountPaid` one-way cleared on Income). R4 first-launch tooltip via `OnboardingService.hasSeenAddTransactionTooltip`. 7 caller sites updated. 5 widget tests. `context.select` slices keep Phase 2.5 lint green. |
| (in-flight) | 7.D1 + preflight | `test/integration/app_state_crud_test.dart` extended with +24 tests (now 40 pass + 3 env-skipped). `scripts/preflight.sh` parser updated to recognise the `+NNNN ~MM: All tests passed!` form so skipped tests no longer break the gate. |

**Test count delta**: 1,833 → 1,862 (+29 net: +5 Phase 5.5 widget tests, +24 D.1 remainder).
**Preflight**: green; **gate currently at `>=1750`** (FINISH_LINE.md §10 calls for ratchet after this session).
**APK**: not rebuilt this session — pending Stage E.
**Field-level highlights for next session**:
- `BulkReassignCategoryAndDelete` SQL is gated by `isDefault = 0` — D.1 tests for it must seed a non-default category first.
- Recurring update/delete fire notification scheduling that crashes under `flutter test` because `FlutterLocalNotificationsPlatform.instance` is a `late final` static. D.1 wraps the call in `try` and asserts the cache contract; full `cancelBillReminder` coverage is gated on the same platform mock as `notification_settings_screen_test.dart_skipped`.
- `state.expenses` is filtered to `selectedMonth` — cross-month tests must use `state.allExpenses`.
- The `path_provider` mock plus `BackupHelper` orphaned-file cleanup races under parallel test isolates — `restoreDeletedAccount` test is skipped pending integration-test harness hardening.

---

## Session 7 — what landed (commits `6bad3c3` → `547b8d6`)

7 commits pushed to `origin/release/v5.0.0`:

| Commit | Phase | What |
|---|---|---|
| `6bad3c3` | 5.6.1 | `lib/screens/history/history_grouping.dart` + 15 unit tests — pure functions for `groupByDay`, `groupByCategory`, `sortGroupKeys`, `formatDateHeader*`. Zero behaviour change. |
| `311c374` | 5.6.2 | `HistoryFilterBar` widget — extracts search field + filter-chip strip. Dumb StatelessWidget; state + debounce stay in parent. |
| `3544eb1` | 5.6.3 | `HistoryList` + `HistoryEmptyState` widgets — RefreshIndicator + ListView.builder shell with tile-builder callbacks. Parent file shrinks 2306 → 1831 lines. |
| `f5e12ae` | 5.6.4 | File relocated from `lib/screens/history_screen.dart` to `lib/screens/history/history_screen.dart`. Two caller imports updated (`main.dart`, `home_screen.dart`). |
| `1445371` | 5.7   | `RecurringItemsScreen` + the two old screens refactored into `recurring/recurring_expenses_view.dart` + `recurring/recurring_income_view.dart` (publicized list widgets + top-level `showAddRecurring*Dialog` helpers). 4 callers updated, 4 widget tests added. |
| `6b10877` | 7.D1  | `test/integration/app_state_crud_test.dart` — 16 end-to-end mutator tests (addExpense, addIncome, delete-trash flows, account CRUD, category CRUD, setBudget). |
| `547b8d6` | docs  | `docs/CHECKLIST.md` ticks 5.6 + 5.7 + D.1 partial; notes remaining D.1 gaps. |

**Test count delta**: 1,798 → 1,833 (+35).
**Preflight**: green on every commit, `flutter analyze` clean.
**Net file change in `lib/screens/`**: history split keeps the same total LOC but the largest single file (`history_screen.dart`) dropped 475 lines and the feature now lives in a self-contained `history/` subfolder; recurring merge consolidated two `Scaffold` wrappers into one `RecurringItemsScreen`.

## Phase 5 status after session 7

| Sub-phase | Status |
|---|---|
| 5.1 Settings | ✅ |
| 5.2 Wallet | ✅ |
| 5.3 Budgets | ✅ |
| 5.4 Analytics | ✅ |
| **5.5 Add Transaction** | **⏳ STILL DEFERRED — highest-risk structural change. 1380 + 1033 line forms to merge. Plan in `docs/SESSION_7_PLAN.md §5`.** |
| **5.6 History split** | ✅ Session 7 |
| **5.7 Recurring merge** | ✅ Session 7 |
| 5.8 Home polish | ✅ |
| 5.9 Secondaries (a–j) | ✅ |
| 5.10 Brand | ✅ |
| 5.11 Spacing retirement | ✅ |

**5.5 is the only Phase 5 item left.** Once it lands, Phase 5 is done.

## What's still gating `v5.0.0+1` ship

In execution order (per `docs/SESSION_7_PLAN.md`):

1. **Stage A — Device smokes** (Phase 6 validations: PIN migration, FLAG_SECURE, PII redactor, widget redaction, backup round-trip). Requires Android device. 1–2 hours.
2. **Stage B.5 — Add Transaction merge** (the deferred item above). 1 day. No device required.
3. **Stage C — SQLCipher migration** (Phase 6.1). 1.5 days. Device required for verification.
4. **Stage D.1 remainder** — additional mutator coverage (updateExpense/Income, markPaid, restore + emptyTrash, recurring CRUD, template CRUD).
5. **Stage D.2 — Hero-screen widget tests** with seeded data. Blocked on B.5.
6. **Stage D.3 — Goldens for 8 hero screens.** Blocked on D.2.
7. **Stage E — Version bump + CHANGELOG + tag + ship.** 1 day. Device required for post-ship smoke.

If picking up next without a device: start with **Stage B.5** (highest-risk, no device needed). Otherwise start with **Stage A**.

## TL;DR — what's done, what's next

| Phase | Status | Tests | What's in it |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 — Pre-flight | ✅ Done | 1,643 baseline | Master plan + checklist + analyze baseline + APP_INFO design brief |
| 1 — Stop the Bleeding | ✅ Done (10/10) | 1,661 (+18) | useTemplate, pruneDistantMonths, Navigator.pushNamed, HomeWidget race, loadData coalesce, addExpense atomic tx, blur perf, fadeController, Android backup hardening, notification redaction |
| 2 — Architectural Foundations | ✅ Done (7/7) | 1,673 (+12) | AppColors → theme/, LuminousTokens consolidated, Luminous widget skeleton, history narrow selects, package_info_plus, NotificationHelper singleton, Hanken Grotesk bundled |
| 3 — Race & Lifecycle | 🟡 7/7 (3.8 deferred) | 1,683 (+10) | Notification payload queue, recurring snackbar stream, FocusManager hook, accountSwitch stream, HomeWidgetHelper dispose, mounted guards |
| 4 — Schema v19 + Data Integrity | ✅ 12/12 | 1,685 (+1) | v19 migration bundle, tx wrapping, soft-delete tag cleanup, backup validation, strict model validation |
| 5 — Luminous Design Integration | 🟢 **17/20 (3 STRUCTURAL deferred)** | 1,798 (session 5 close was 1,809; -28 from retired `spacing_test.dart` + +17 new widget tests across 8 new screen tests) | **Session 6 landed 5.2 Wallet, 5.4 Analytics, all 9 remaining 5.9 secondaries, and 5.11 Spacing retirement.** 5.5/5.6/5.7 (STRUCTURAL) are the only Phase 5 items left, intentionally deferred. |
| 6 — Security Hardening | 🟡 5/6 | 1,798 | 6.2/4/5/6 + 6.3 (crypto + UX) done; **6.1 SQLCipher** still ahead. |
| 7 — Test Coverage Rebuild | 🟡 7/10 (D.1 skip, D.6/D.8 deferred) | 1,798 | Session 6 added Wallet/Trash/Quick-Templates/Export/Category-Manager/Backup tests; remaining 7.2 CRUD mutators + 7.6 hero widget tests + 7.8 goldens still ahead. |
| 8 — Polish & Ship | 🟡 2/5 | 1,798 | 8.1 preflight + lint, 8.3 APK build verified previously. 8.2 perf / 8.4 version bump / 8.5 ship pipeline still ahead. |

**Total test growth this session**: −11 net (1,809 → 1,798). The drop is from retiring the 28-test `test/constants/spacing_test.dart` when its source file moved to `TRASH/`. New widget tests landed: +17 (Trash 2, Quick Templates 3, Export 5, Category Manager 3, Backup 2, Wallet 2). Real coverage went up; the count dipped only because the retired tests were tautological constant pins.

**APK size**: 59.4 MB at session 4 close (no new build this session — Phase 5 nearly complete; rebuild is part of Stage E before tagging).

## What landed in session 6 (this session)

### Stage B — Phase 5 Luminous Design Integration (the bulk of the work)

* **5.2 Wallet & Accounts** (`d312519`) — renamed `account_manager_screen.dart` → `wallet_screen.dart`, class `AccountManagerScreen` → `WalletScreen`. `GlassTopAppBar("Wallet")` (no leading BackButton — sits behind the main-nav tab); account cards wrap in `GlassPanel` with a primary-tinted `boxShadow` on the active row to read instead of the old `border-width: 2` highlight. `_DeletedAccountsSection` retained. Empty state in `GlassPanel`. `main.dart` import + reference updated; old file moved to `TRASH/`. **2 widget tests** at `test/screens/wallet_screen_test.dart`.

* **5.4 Analytics & Insights** (`9501a72`) — `SliverAppBar` + `CustomScrollView` → `GlassTopAppBar` + `SingleChildScrollView`. Eight inner Container cards (across `_SpendingTrendsChart`, `_SpendingChart`, `_BudgetProgress`, `_CategoryBreakdown`, `_MonthOverMonthInsights`, and their empty states) swapped to `GlassPanel` via a precise three-pattern regex pass. `fl_chart` retained — the chart primitives now sit inside frosted GlassPanel surfaces. `FadeInOnLoad` staggered entry preserved. **No widget test** (the chart sub-widgets use `AnimationController` tickers that leak timers under `flutter test` teardown without chart-specific mocking — deferred to D.6 hero widget tests).

* **5.9a Onboarding** (`d3d8bbd`) — slide content rendered inside `GlassPanel` over the OrganicBlobBackground; `AnimatedContainer` page indicators morph between dot (8x8) and pill (24x8) on selection.

* **5.9b PIN Setup** (`d3d8bbd`) — `GlassTopAppBar` + transparent scaffold; PIN length selector / dots / number pad untouched except for inlined Spacing.* literals.

* **5.9c PIN Unlock** (`d3d8bbd`) — wallet-icon brand mark now wrapped in `GlassPanel`; transparent scaffold so the blob background bleeds through. Title still "FinanceFlow" per session-3.

* **5.9e Export Data** (`acbd14d`) — `GlassTopAppBar`, info banner + each data-type option + custom-range buttons wrapped in `GlassPanel`; 5 date-range chips swapped to `GlassPillChip`. **5 widget tests** at `test/screens/export_data_screen_test.dart`.

* **5.9f Trash** (`b356bcd`) — `GlassTopAppBar` (delete-forever IconButton trailing when non-empty), `GlassSegmentedControl` replaces the old `TabBar` for Expenses / Income, each deleted-item card wrapped in `GlassPanel`, empty states in `GlassPanel`. `TabController` + `SingleTickerProviderStateMixin` dropped — no longer needed. **2 widget tests** at `test/screens/trash_screen_test.dart`.

* **5.9g Category Manager** (`236192b`) — `SliverAppBar` → `GlassTopAppBar`; `EXPENSE CATEGORIES` and `INCOME CATEGORIES` tile lists wrapped in `GlassPanel`; empty state in `GlassPanel`. **3 widget tests** at `test/screens/category_manager_screen_test.dart` (uses `pumpAndSettle(600ms)` to drain `FadeInOnLoad` + `BounceAnimation` tickers before teardown).

* **5.9h Backup & Restore** (`c0c6201`) — `GlassTopAppBar` (selection-mode aware: close-X leading + Select-All / delete trailing when in bulk-delete mode); `_SectionCard` (Export Backup / Restore Backup) rewritten on a `GlassPanel` surface. Behavioural flows (passphrase confirmation, retry-loop restore, legacy v2/v3 passthrough) untouched. **2 widget tests** at `test/screens/backup_restore_screen_test.dart`.

* **5.9i Quick Templates** (`dfe0102`) — `GlassTopAppBar`, each template card wrapped in `GlassPanel` with accent-tinted leading icon (`incomeGreen` for income, `onSurface` for expense). Empty state in `GlassPanel`. **3 widget tests** at `test/screens/quick_templates_screen_test.dart`.

* **5.9j Notification Settings** (`81227f1`) — `GlassTopAppBar`, permission warning + info banner in `GlassPanel`. The three toggle rows (Bill Reminders / Budget Alerts / Monthly Summary) consolidated into a single `GlassListSection` named "Alerts", each row a `GlassListTile` with a `Switch` trailing. Reminder Time + Test Notification in their own `GlassListSection`s. Example notifications render inside `GlassPanel`s (the Row now uses `Expanded` + `TextOverflow.ellipsis` to prevent overflow). **No widget test** — `_checkPermissionStatus()` in initState calls into `flutter_local_notifications`, whose `FlutterLocalNotificationsPlatform.instance` is a `late final` static that needs platform-channel mocking we don't have scaffolding for. Deferred to C.4 device smoke.

### Stage B.11 — Spacing.* full removal

* **5.11** (`a5edd19`) — every remaining `Spacing.*` call site in lib/ inlined to numeric literals via a Python regex sweep across 9 files (`add_expense`, `add_income`, `add_payment_dialog`, `advanced_filter_dialog`, `history_screen`, `recurring_expenses`, `recurring_income`, `dialog_helpers`, `snackbar_helper`). `lib/constants/spacing.dart` retired to `TRASH/spacing.dart_retired`. `test/constants/spacing_test.dart` retired alongside. The B.11 gate from `docs/NEXT_STEPS.md` now reads true:

  ```
  grep -rn "Spacing\." lib/  → 0 hits (excluding comments).
  ```

### What did NOT land in session 6

* **5.5 Add Transaction** (STRUCTURAL — delete `add_hub_screen`/`add_expense_screen`/`add_income_screen`, create unified `add_transaction_screen.dart` with type segmented control). Touches ~3000 lines and 7+ caller sites; needs its own session.
* **5.6 Transaction History split** (STRUCTURAL — split the 2,307-line `history_screen.dart` into `lib/screens/history/{history_screen,history_filter_bar,history_list,history_grouping}.dart`). Needs its own session.
* **5.7 Recurring Items merge** (STRUCTURAL — merge `recurring_expenses_screen.dart` + `recurring_income_screen.dart` into `recurring_items_screen.dart`). Risk R5: must not touch notification IDs.
* **6.1 SQLCipher** — high-risk, needs device.
* **Stage E** (ship pipeline) — version stays at `4.4.0+6` until 5.5/5.6/5.7 land. Bumping to `5.0.0+1` without those would misrepresent the release.

## What's left to reach `v5.0.0+1`

See `docs/NEXT_STEPS.md` for the full per-task spec. Headline gaps:

### Stage B — Phase 5 structural redesigns
- **B.5** Add Transaction (STRUCTURAL): delete `add_hub_screen.dart` + `add_expense_screen.dart` + `add_income_screen.dart`; create a single `add_transaction_screen.dart` with type segmented control. R4 risk: first-launch tooltip needed.
- **B.6** Transaction History (STRUCTURAL): split `history_screen.dart` (2,307 lines) into `lib/screens/history/{history_screen,history_filter_bar,history_list,history_grouping}.dart`.
- **B.7** Recurring Items (STRUCTURAL): merge `recurring_expenses_screen.dart` + `recurring_income_screen.dart` into one `recurring_items_screen.dart`.

### Stage C — Phase 6 security remainder
- **C.3** SQLCipher migration. High-risk; needs device.

### Stage D — Phase 7 test coverage
- **D.2** Remaining AppState mutators — the CRUD ones that touch DB.
- **D.6** Hero-screen widget tests with seeded data (the screens currently covered by session-6 smoke tests would get richer per-state assertions).
- **D.8** Goldens — defer until Stage B.5/B.6/B.7 land.

### Stage E — Ship
- **E.1** DevTools perf pass on real device.
- **E.2** Version bump → `5.0.0+1` + CHANGELOG entry + tag.
- **E.3–E.6** Ship pipeline (build → copy to landing → vercel → GitHub release → end-to-end smoke).

## Pointers for the next session

1. **Push first.** Local is 15 commits ahead of origin:
   ```bash
   git push origin release/v5.0.0
   # Fast-forward main too:
   git checkout main && git merge --ff-only release/v5.0.0 && git push origin main
   git checkout release/v5.0.0
   ```
2. **Re-read** `docs/NEXT_STEPS.md` and this handoff first.
3. **Run `bash scripts/preflight.sh`** — should be green at 1,798 (gate ≥ 1750).
4. **Pick the right next workstream:**
   - **Highest-value next: 5.6 History split** — 2,307-line file split into 4 files, low-risk because no behavioural changes (pure refactor). Big readability win.
   - **Hardest: 5.5 Add Transaction** — merges three screens; needs the first-launch tooltip (`OnboardingService.seenAddHubTooltip`). Touches 7+ caller sites across `home_screen`, `history_screen`, `main.dart`.
   - **Medium: 5.7 Recurring Items merge** — careful with notification IDs (Phase 1.10).
   - **De-risk: 6.1 SQLCipher** — high data-loss risk if it fails; pair-up with device.
   - **Test debt: D.6 + D.8** — wait until 5.5/5.6/5.7 land so we aren't writing tests against soon-to-be-deleted screens.
5. **Per-screen pattern (well-established by session 5 + 6):**
   - Replace top `Scaffold.appBar` / `SliverAppBar` with `GlassTopAppBar` (use `BackButton` in leading slot for child screens; omit for main-nav-rooted screens like Wallet/Analytics).
   - Wrap structural Containers in `GlassPanel`.
   - Inline `Spacing.*` calls — every remaining one is in deferred 5.5/5.6/5.7 territory now.
   - For list-shaped screens: prefer `GlassListSection` + `GlassListTile`.
   - Widget tests at `test/screens/<name>_test.dart`:
     ```dart
     await tester.binding.setSurfaceSize(const Size(420, 1400));
     addTearDown(() => tester.binding.setSurfaceSize(null));
     await makeFreshDb();          // for screens that hit AppState DB methods
     SharedPreferences.setMockInitialValues(<String, Object>{});
     messenger.setMockMethodCallHandler(secureChannel, (_) async => null);
     ```
   - For screens that load DB in initState: use `tester.pump()` + `tester.runAsync(() => Future.delayed(200ms))` + `tester.pump()`. Avoid `pumpAndSettle` — `StaggeredListItem` animations can stay pending indefinitely under the test ticker.
   - For screens with `BounceAnimation` / `FadeInOnLoad` in static empty states: `pumpAndSettle(600ms)` works fine.
6. **At session end**, fast-forward-merge `release/v5.0.0` into `main` and push.

## Risk register (delta this session)

No new risks introduced. **R5 (Recurring merge breaks notifications)** still unmitigated — 5.7 not started.

Notable mitigation:
- Phase 5.9j (Notification Settings) skipped its widget test rather than introduce a brittle mock of `FlutterLocalNotificationsPlatform.instance` (late-final static). Documented in `TRASH/notification_settings_screen_test.dart_skipped` for future revisit.
- Phase 5.4 (Analytics) skipped its widget test for the same kind of reason — chart tickers leak under `flutter test` teardown without chart-specific mocking. Documented in `TRASH/analytics_screen_test.dart_skipped`.

Both gaps will close cleanly when D.6 lands with proper hero-screen mocking.
