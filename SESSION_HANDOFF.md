# Session Handoff — v5.0.0 Release Branch

**Branch**: `release/v5.0.0` — pushed to origin at session-7 close. `origin/release/v5.0.0` HEAD is `547b8d6`.
**Master plan**: `docs/MASTER_PLAN.md`
**Per-task checklist**: `docs/CHECKLIST.md`
**Session 7 playbook**: `docs/SESSION_7_PLAN.md`
**Next-steps plan**: `docs/NEXT_STEPS.md`
**Last committed work at handoff**: session 7 — Phase 5.6 History split (4 commits), Phase 5.7 Recurring merge, D.1 partial CRUD coverage.
**Paused**: 2026-05-12 (Session 7 — structural 5.6 + 5.7 done; **5.5 Add Transaction merge** and Phase 6.1 SQLCipher still ahead.)

> To resume: `git fetch && git status` (should be clean and in sync), then read this file, `docs/SESSION_7_PLAN.md`, and `docs/CHECKLIST.md`. The next gate is Stage A device smokes (if device available) or Stage B.5 Add Transaction merge (if no device — but B.5 is rated "1 day, HIGHEST RISK" so plan accordingly).

## Session 7 — what landed (commits `6bad3c3` → `547b8d6`)

7 commits pushed to `origin/release/v5.0.0`:

| Commit | Phase | What |
|---|---|---|
| `6bad3c3` | 5.6.1 | `lib/screens/history/history_grouping.dart` + 15 unit tests — pure functions for `groupByDay`, `groupByCategory`, `sortGroupKeys`, `formatDateHeader*`. Zero behaviour change. |
| `311c374` | 5.6.2 | `HistoryFilterBar` widget — extracts search field + filter-chip strip. Dumb StatelessWidget; state + debounce stay in parent. |
| `3544eb1` | 5.6.3 | `HistoryList` + `HistoryEmptyState` widgets — RefreshIndicator + ListView.builder shell with tile-builder callbacks. Parent file shrinks 2306 → 1831 lines. |
| `f5e12ae` | 5.6.4 | File relocated from `lib/screens/history_screen.dart` to `lib/screens/history/history_screen.dart`. Two caller imports updated (`main.dart`, `home_screen.dart`). |
| `1445371` | 5.7   | `RecurringItemsScreen` + the two old screens refactored into `recurring/recurring_expenses_view.dart` + `recurring/recurring_income_view.dart` (publicized list widgets + top-level `showAddRecurring*Dialog` helpers). 4 callers updated, 4 widget tests added. |
| `6b10877` | 7.D1  | `test/integration/app_state_crud_test.dart` — 16 end-to-end mutator tests (addExpense, addIncome, delete-trash flows, account CRUD, category CRUD, setBudget). |
| `547b8d6` | docs  | `docs/CHECKLIST.md` ticks 5.6 + 5.7 + D.1 partial; notes remaining D.1 gaps. |

**Test count delta**: 1,798 → 1,833 (+35).
**Preflight**: green on every commit, `flutter analyze` clean.
**Net file change in `lib/screens/`**: history split keeps the same total LOC but the largest single file (`history_screen.dart`) dropped 475 lines and the feature now lives in a self-contained `history/` subfolder; recurring merge consolidated two `Scaffold` wrappers into one `RecurringItemsScreen`.

## Phase 5 status after session 7

| Sub-phase | Status |
|---|---|
| 5.1 Settings | ✅ |
| 5.2 Wallet | ✅ |
| 5.3 Budgets | ✅ |
| 5.4 Analytics | ✅ |
| **5.5 Add Transaction** | **⏳ STILL DEFERRED — highest-risk structural change. 1380 + 1033 line forms to merge. Plan in `docs/SESSION_7_PLAN.md §5`.** |
| **5.6 History split** | ✅ Session 7 |
| **5.7 Recurring merge** | ✅ Session 7 |
| 5.8 Home polish | ✅ |
| 5.9 Secondaries (a–j) | ✅ |
| 5.10 Brand | ✅ |
| 5.11 Spacing retirement | ✅ |

**5.5 is the only Phase 5 item left.** Once it lands, Phase 5 is done.

## What's still gating `v5.0.0+1` ship

In execution order (per `docs/SESSION_7_PLAN.md`):

1. **Stage A — Device smokes** (Phase 6 validations: PIN migration, FLAG_SECURE, PII redactor, widget redaction, backup round-trip). Requires Android device. 1–2 hours.
2. **Stage B.5 — Add Transaction merge** (the deferred item above). 1 day. No device required.
3. **Stage C — SQLCipher migration** (Phase 6.1). 1.5 days. Device required for verification.
4. **Stage D.1 remainder** — additional mutator coverage (updateExpense/Income, markPaid, restore + emptyTrash, recurring CRUD, template CRUD).
5. **Stage D.2 — Hero-screen widget tests** with seeded data. Blocked on B.5.
6. **Stage D.3 — Goldens for 8 hero screens.** Blocked on D.2.
7. **Stage E — Version bump + CHANGELOG + tag + ship.** 1 day. Device required for post-ship smoke.

If picking up next without a device: start with **Stage B.5** (highest-risk, no device needed). Otherwise start with **Stage A**.

## TL;DR — what's done, what's next

| Phase | Status | Tests | What's in it |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 — Pre-flight | ✅ Done | 1,643 baseline | Master plan + checklist + analyze baseline + APP_INFO design brief |
| 1 — Stop the Bleeding | ✅ Done (10/10) | 1,661 (+18) | useTemplate, pruneDistantMonths, Navigator.pushNamed, HomeWidget race, loadData coalesce, addExpense atomic tx, blur perf, fadeController, Android backup hardening, notification redaction |
| 2 — Architectural Foundations | ✅ Done (7/7) | 1,673 (+12) | AppColors → theme/, LuminousTokens consolidated, Luminous widget skeleton, history narrow selects, package_info_plus, NotificationHelper singleton, Hanken Grotesk bundled |
| 3 — Race & Lifecycle | 🟡 7/7 (3.8 deferred) | 1,683 (+10) | Notification payload queue, recurring snackbar stream, FocusManager hook, accountSwitch stream, HomeWidgetHelper dispose, mounted guards |
| 4 — Schema v19 + Data Integrity | ✅ 12/12 | 1,685 (+1) | v19 migration bundle, tx wrapping, soft-delete tag cleanup, backup validation, strict model validation |
| 5 — Luminous Design Integration | 🟢 **17/20 (3 STRUCTURAL deferred)** | 1,798 (session 5 close was 1,809; -28 from retired `spacing_test.dart` + +17 new widget tests across 8 new screen tests) | **Session 6 landed 5.2 Wallet, 5.4 Analytics, all 9 remaining 5.9 secondaries, and 5.11 Spacing retirement.** 5.5/5.6/5.7 (STRUCTURAL) are the only Phase 5 items left, intentionally deferred. |
| 6 — Security Hardening | 🟡 5/6 | 1,798 | 6.2/4/5/6 + 6.3 (crypto + UX) done; **6.1 SQLCipher** still ahead. |
| 7 — Test Coverage Rebuild | 🟡 7/10 (D.1 skip, D.6/D.8 deferred) | 1,798 | Session 6 added Wallet/Trash/Quick-Templates/Export/Category-Manager/Backup tests; remaining 7.2 CRUD mutators + 7.6 hero widget tests + 7.8 goldens still ahead. |
| 8 — Polish & Ship | 🟡 2/5 | 1,798 | 8.1 preflight + lint, 8.3 APK build verified previously. 8.2 perf / 8.4 version bump / 8.5 ship pipeline still ahead. |

**Total test growth this session**: −11 net (1,809 → 1,798). The drop is from retiring the 28-test `test/constants/spacing_test.dart` when its source file moved to `TRASH/`. New widget tests landed: +17 (Trash 2, Quick Templates 3, Export 5, Category Manager 3, Backup 2, Wallet 2). Real coverage went up; the count dipped only because the retired tests were tautological constant pins.

**APK size**: 59.4 MB at session 4 close (no new build this session — Phase 5 nearly complete; rebuild is part of Stage E before tagging).

## What landed in session 6 (this session)

### Stage B — Phase 5 Luminous Design Integration (the bulk of the work)

* **5.2 Wallet & Accounts** (`d312519`) — renamed `account_manager_screen.dart` → `wallet_screen.dart`, class `AccountManagerScreen` → `WalletScreen`. `GlassTopAppBar("Wallet")` (no leading BackButton — sits behind the main-nav tab); account cards wrap in `GlassPanel` with a primary-tinted `boxShadow` on the active row to read instead of the old `border-width: 2` highlight. `_DeletedAccountsSection` retained. Empty state in `GlassPanel`. `main.dart` import + reference updated; old file moved to `TRASH/`. **2 widget tests** at `test/screens/wallet_screen_test.dart`.

* **5.4 Analytics & Insights** (`9501a72`) — `SliverAppBar` + `CustomScrollView` → `GlassTopAppBar` + `SingleChildScrollView`. Eight inner Container cards (across `_SpendingTrendsChart`, `_SpendingChart`, `_BudgetProgress`, `_CategoryBreakdown`, `_MonthOverMonthInsights`, and their empty states) swapped to `GlassPanel` via a precise three-pattern regex pass. `fl_chart` retained — the chart primitives now sit inside frosted GlassPanel surfaces. `FadeInOnLoad` staggered entry preserved. **No widget test** (the chart sub-widgets use `AnimationController` tickers that leak timers under `flutter test` teardown without chart-specific mocking — deferred to D.6 hero widget tests).

* **5.9a Onboarding** (`d3d8bbd`) — slide content rendered inside `GlassPanel` over the OrganicBlobBackground; `AnimatedContainer` page indicators morph between dot (8x8) and pill (24x8) on selection.

* **5.9b PIN Setup** (`d3d8bbd`) — `GlassTopAppBar` + transparent scaffold; PIN length selector / dots / number pad untouched except for inlined Spacing.* literals.

* **5.9c PIN Unlock** (`d3d8bbd`) — wallet-icon brand mark now wrapped in `GlassPanel`; transparent scaffold so the blob background bleeds through. Title still "FinanceFlow" per session-3.

* **5.9e Export Data** (`acbd14d`) — `GlassTopAppBar`, info banner + each data-type option + custom-range buttons wrapped in `GlassPanel`; 5 date-range chips swapped to `GlassPillChip`. **5 widget tests** at `test/screens/export_data_screen_test.dart`.

* **5.9f Trash** (`b356bcd`) — `GlassTopAppBar` (delete-forever IconButton trailing when non-empty), `GlassSegmentedControl` replaces the old `TabBar` for Expenses / Income, each deleted-item card wrapped in `GlassPanel`, empty states in `GlassPanel`. `TabController` + `SingleTickerProviderStateMixin` dropped — no longer needed. **2 widget tests** at `test/screens/trash_screen_test.dart`.

* **5.9g Category Manager** (`236192b`) — `SliverAppBar` → `GlassTopAppBar`; `EXPENSE CATEGORIES` and `INCOME CATEGORIES` tile lists wrapped in `GlassPanel`; empty state in `GlassPanel`. **3 widget tests** at `test/screens/category_manager_screen_test.dart` (uses `pumpAndSettle(600ms)` to drain `FadeInOnLoad` + `BounceAnimation` tickers before teardown).

* **5.9h Backup & Restore** (`c0c6201`) — `GlassTopAppBar` (selection-mode aware: close-X leading + Select-All / delete trailing when in bulk-delete mode); `_SectionCard` (Export Backup / Restore Backup) rewritten on a `GlassPanel` surface. Behavioural flows (passphrase confirmation, retry-loop restore, legacy v2/v3 passthrough) untouched. **2 widget tests** at `test/screens/backup_restore_screen_test.dart`.

* **5.9i Quick Templates** (`dfe0102`) — `GlassTopAppBar`, each template card wrapped in `GlassPanel` with accent-tinted leading icon (`incomeGreen` for income, `onSurface` for expense). Empty state in `GlassPanel`. **3 widget tests** at `test/screens/quick_templates_screen_test.dart`.

* **5.9j Notification Settings** (`81227f1`) — `GlassTopAppBar`, permission warning + info banner in `GlassPanel`. The three toggle rows (Bill Reminders / Budget Alerts / Monthly Summary) consolidated into a single `GlassListSection` named "Alerts", each row a `GlassListTile` with a `Switch` trailing. Reminder Time + Test Notification in their own `GlassListSection`s. Example notifications render inside `GlassPanel`s (the Row now uses `Expanded` + `TextOverflow.ellipsis` to prevent overflow). **No widget test** — `_checkPermissionStatus()` in initState calls into `flutter_local_notifications`, whose `FlutterLocalNotificationsPlatform.instance` is a `late final` static that needs platform-channel mocking we don't have scaffolding for. Deferred to C.4 device smoke.

### Stage B.11 — Spacing.* full removal

* **5.11** (`a5edd19`) — every remaining `Spacing.*` call site in lib/ inlined to numeric literals via a Python regex sweep across 9 files (`add_expense`, `add_income`, `add_payment_dialog`, `advanced_filter_dialog`, `history_screen`, `recurring_expenses`, `recurring_income`, `dialog_helpers`, `snackbar_helper`). `lib/constants/spacing.dart` retired to `TRASH/spacing.dart_retired`. `test/constants/spacing_test.dart` retired alongside. The B.11 gate from `docs/NEXT_STEPS.md` now reads true:

  ```
  grep -rn "Spacing\." lib/  → 0 hits (excluding comments).
  ```

### What did NOT land in session 6

* **5.5 Add Transaction** (STRUCTURAL — delete `add_hub_screen`/`add_expense_screen`/`add_income_screen`, create unified `add_transaction_screen.dart` with type segmented control). Touches ~3000 lines and 7+ caller sites; needs its own session.
* **5.6 Transaction History split** (STRUCTURAL — split the 2,307-line `history_screen.dart` into `lib/screens/history/{history_screen,history_filter_bar,history_list,history_grouping}.dart`). Needs its own session.
* **5.7 Recurring Items merge** (STRUCTURAL — merge `recurring_expenses_screen.dart` + `recurring_income_screen.dart` into `recurring_items_screen.dart`). Risk R5: must not touch notification IDs.
* **6.1 SQLCipher** — high-risk, needs device.
* **Stage E** (ship pipeline) — version stays at `4.4.0+6` until 5.5/5.6/5.7 land. Bumping to `5.0.0+1` without those would misrepresent the release.

## State of the working tree at handoff (Session 6 close)

| Surface | State |
|---|---|
| Branch | `release/v5.0.0` — **local ahead of `origin/release/v5.0.0` by 15 commits**; next session should `git push` first |
| HEAD | session-6 docs-update commit |
| Commits since the pre-v5 `main` (`233134f`) diverged | 44 |
| `flutter analyze` | No issues found |
| `flutter test` | 1,798 pass (was 1,809 at session 5 close — net −11; +17 new widget tests, −28 retired Spacing constant tests) |
| `flutter build apk --release` | not rerun this session; last verified 59.4 MB at session 4 |
| `bash scripts/preflight.sh` | green (gate ≥ 1750) |
| DB schema version | 19 (unchanged) |
| `pubspec.yaml` version | `4.4.0+6` (unchanged — version bump waits on 5.5/5.6/5.7) |
| New deps this session | none |

## What's left to reach `v5.0.0+1`

See `docs/NEXT_STEPS.md` for the full per-task spec. Headline gaps:

### Stage B — Phase 5 structural redesigns
- **B.5** Add Transaction (STRUCTURAL): delete `add_hub_screen.dart` + `add_expense_screen.dart` + `add_income_screen.dart`; create a single `add_transaction_screen.dart` with type segmented control. R4 risk: first-launch tooltip needed.
- **B.6** Transaction History (STRUCTURAL): split `history_screen.dart` (2,307 lines) into `lib/screens/history/{history_screen,history_filter_bar,history_list,history_grouping}.dart`.
- **B.7** Recurring Items (STRUCTURAL): merge `recurring_expenses_screen.dart` + `recurring_income_screen.dart` into one `recurring_items_screen.dart`.

### Stage C — Phase 6 security remainder
- **C.3** SQLCipher migration. High-risk; needs device.

### Stage D — Phase 7 test coverage
- **D.2** Remaining AppState mutators — the CRUD ones that touch DB.
- **D.6** Hero-screen widget tests with seeded data (the screens currently covered by session-6 smoke tests would get richer per-state assertions).
- **D.8** Goldens — defer until Stage B.5/B.6/B.7 land.

### Stage E — Ship
- **E.1** DevTools perf pass on real device.
- **E.2** Version bump → `5.0.0+1` + CHANGELOG entry + tag.
- **E.3–E.6** Ship pipeline (build → copy to landing → vercel → GitHub release → end-to-end smoke).

## Pointers for the next session

1. **Push first.** Local is 15 commits ahead of origin:
   ```bash
   git push origin release/v5.0.0
   # Fast-forward main too:
   git checkout main && git merge --ff-only release/v5.0.0 && git push origin main
   git checkout release/v5.0.0
   ```
2. **Re-read** `docs/NEXT_STEPS.md` and this handoff first.
3. **Run `bash scripts/preflight.sh`** — should be green at 1,798 (gate ≥ 1750).
4. **Pick the right next workstream:**
   - **Highest-value next: 5.6 History split** — 2,307-line file split into 4 files, low-risk because no behavioural changes (pure refactor). Big readability win.
   - **Hardest: 5.5 Add Transaction** — merges three screens; needs the first-launch tooltip (`OnboardingService.seenAddHubTooltip`). Touches 7+ caller sites across `home_screen`, `history_screen`, `main.dart`.
   - **Medium: 5.7 Recurring Items merge** — careful with notification IDs (Phase 1.10).
   - **De-risk: 6.1 SQLCipher** — high data-loss risk if it fails; pair-up with device.
   - **Test debt: D.6 + D.8** — wait until 5.5/5.6/5.7 land so we aren't writing tests against soon-to-be-deleted screens.
5. **Per-screen pattern (well-established by session 5 + 6):**
   - Replace top `Scaffold.appBar` / `SliverAppBar` with `GlassTopAppBar` (use `BackButton` in leading slot for child screens; omit for main-nav-rooted screens like Wallet/Analytics).
   - Wrap structural Containers in `GlassPanel`.
   - Inline `Spacing.*` calls — every remaining one is in deferred 5.5/5.6/5.7 territory now.
   - For list-shaped screens: prefer `GlassListSection` + `GlassListTile`.
   - Widget tests at `test/screens/<name>_test.dart`:
     ```dart
     await tester.binding.setSurfaceSize(const Size(420, 1400));
     addTearDown(() => tester.binding.setSurfaceSize(null));
     await makeFreshDb();          // for screens that hit AppState DB methods
     SharedPreferences.setMockInitialValues(<String, Object>{});
     messenger.setMockMethodCallHandler(secureChannel, (_) async => null);
     ```
   - For screens that load DB in initState: use `tester.pump()` + `tester.runAsync(() => Future.delayed(200ms))` + `tester.pump()`. Avoid `pumpAndSettle` — `StaggeredListItem` animations can stay pending indefinitely under the test ticker.
   - For screens with `BounceAnimation` / `FadeInOnLoad` in static empty states: `pumpAndSettle(600ms)` works fine.
6. **At session end**, fast-forward-merge `release/v5.0.0` into `main` and push.

---

## Risk register (delta this session)

No new risks introduced. **R5 (Recurring merge breaks notifications)** still unmitigated — 5.7 not started.

Notable mitigation:
- Phase 5.9j (Notification Settings) skipped its widget test rather than introduce a brittle mock of `FlutterLocalNotificationsPlatform.instance` (late-final static). Documented in `TRASH/notification_settings_screen_test.dart_skipped` for future revisit.
- Phase 5.4 (Analytics) skipped its widget test for the same kind of reason — chart tickers leak under `flutter test` teardown without chart-specific mocking. Documented in `TRASH/analytics_screen_test.dart_skipped`.

Both gaps will close cleanly when D.6 lands with proper hero-screen mocking.

**End of handoff. Last touched 2026-05-12 (Session 6).**
